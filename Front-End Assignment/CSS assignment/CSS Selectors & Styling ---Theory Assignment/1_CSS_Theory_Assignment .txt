ï‚· Question 1: What is a CSS selector? Provide examples of element, class, and ID selectors.


Ans : A CSS selector is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements based on their attributes, such as element type, class, or ID. Selectors determine which HTML elements the CSS rules will apply to.

Types of CSS Selectors:.

Element Selector: Selects elements based on their tag name.

Example:
p {
    color: blue;
}

This will select all <p> (paragraph) elements and set their text color to blue.
Class Selector: Selects elements based on their class attribute.

Example:

.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

This will select all elements with the class highlight and apply a yellow background color.
ID Selector: Selects a specific element based on its ID attribute. An ID must be unique within a page.

Example:

#header {
    font-size: 24px;
}
This will select the element with the ID header and set its font size to 24px.


Key Points:

Element selectors target elements by their tag name (e.g., div, p, h1).
Class selectors target elements by their class attribute (e.g., .class-name).
ID selectors target elements by their unique id attribute (e.g., #id-name).
These selectors are often combined in more complex ways to style specific elements on a webpage.
