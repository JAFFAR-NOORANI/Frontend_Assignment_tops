Question 2: Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple styles
get resolved?

Ans: CSS specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element. It is calculated based on a hierarchy:

Inline styles (highest priority).
ID selectors.
Class, attribute, and pseudo-classes.
Element selectors (lowest priority).

When conflicts occur, the rule with the highest specificity is applied. If specificity is the same, the rule defined last in the CSS is used.
