Question 3: What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.


Ans : 
***** Internal CSS: Styles are placed within the <style> tag in the HTML documentâ€™s <head>. Best for single pages but harder to maintain for larger sites.

Advantages:

Useful for styling a single HTML page.
Keeps the CSS within the same document, reducing external dependencies.

Disadvantages:

Styles are only applied to that specific page.
Increases the size of the HTML file, making it less efficient.
Difficult to maintain for larger projects with multiple pages.

***** External CSS: Styles are in a separate .css file linked to HTML. Best for large sites, promotes reusability, but requires an extra HTTP request.

Advantages:

Styles can be reused across multiple pages, promoting consistency.
Keeps HTML files clean and smaller.
Easier to maintain for larger websites.

Disadvantages:

Requires an additional HTTP request to load the external CSS file, potentially increasing load time.
Changes in the CSS file affect all linked pages, so testing is necessary.

*****  Inline CSS: Styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. Quick for individual elements but not scalable or maintainable for large projects.

Advantages:

Useful for applying styles to individual elements quickly.
No need to link or include external CSS files.

Disadvantages:

Not scalable for styling multiple elements.
Difficult to maintain, especially in large documents.
Overrides other styles and lacks reusability.
