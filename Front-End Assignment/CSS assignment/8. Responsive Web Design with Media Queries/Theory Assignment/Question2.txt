Question 2: Describe the grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-gap properties. Provide examples of how to use them.

Ans : 

The `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-gap` are essential CSS Grid Layout properties for defining the structure of a grid container.

1) grid-template-columns Defines the column sizes in a grid. It accepts values like fixed units (`px`, `em`), percentages, or flexible values (`fr`).
  For Example: `grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 1fr;` 
  This will create a grid with three columns, where the first two columns are 100px and
  200px wide, and the third column takes up any remaining space.

2) grid-template-rows Defines the row sizes in a grid. Similar to columns, it accepts fixed units or flexible values.
  For Example: `grid-template-rows: auto 150px 1fr;
  This will create a grid with three rows, where the first row is automatically sized, the second
  row is 150px high, and the third row takes up any remaining space.

3) grid-gap Defines the gap between rows and columns.
  For Example: grid-gap: 20px;
  This will create a grid with a 20px gap between rows and columns.


Example:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 50px auto 1fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
```
This defines a grid with 3 columns and 3 rows, with a 10px gap between them.
