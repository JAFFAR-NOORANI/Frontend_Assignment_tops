Question 1: Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border,
margin). How does each affect the size of an element?

Ans : 
The **CSS Box Model** is a fundamental concept in web design that defines how the total size and spacing of elements are calculated. It consists of four components: **content**, **padding**, **border**, and **margin**. Each component affects the size and positioning of an element differently.

### Components of the CSS Box Model:

1. **Content**:
   - **Definition**: This is the area where the actual content (text, images, etc.) of the element is displayed.
   - **Effect on size**: The width and height properties define the size of the content area. It is the core of the element, and the size of the content directly determines the element’s initial size.

2. **Padding**:
   - **Definition**: Padding is the space between the content and the border. It provides internal spacing around the content.
   - **Effect on size**: Padding increases the overall size of the element. For example, if the padding is 10px, the element's total size will grow by 20px (10px on both sides) for each dimension (width and height). Padding is added to the element's width and height in the **content-box** model.

3. **Border**:
   - **Definition**: The border is a line that wraps around the padding (if any) and content. It can have different styles (solid, dotted, etc.) and thickness.
   - **Effect on size**: Border adds to the total width and height of the element. If a border is 5px thick, it will increase the element's size by 10px (5px on both sides) for each dimension. Like padding, the border is also added to the width and height in the **content-box** model.

4. **Margin**:
   - **Definition**: Margin is the outermost space, creating distance between the element’s border and surrounding elements.
   - **Effect on size**: Margins do not affect the actual size of the element but control the spacing between the element and others on the page. For example, a 20px margin will not affect the width or height but will create 20px of space around the element.

### Total Size of an Element (Content-Box Model):
In the **content-box** model (the default), the element's total size is calculated by adding content, padding, and border:

- **Total Width** = Content Width + Left Padding + Right Padding + Left Border + Right Border
- **Total Height** = Content Height + Top Padding + Bottom Padding + Top Border + Bottom Border

### Example:
```css
div {
    width: 200px;    /* Content width */
    padding: 20px;   /* Padding */
    border: 5px solid black; /* Border */
    margin: 15px;    /* Margin */
}
```

- The **content** is 200px wide.
- **Padding** adds 40px (20px on each side).
- **Border** adds 10px (5px on each side).
- **Margin** adds 30px (15px on each side), but it doesn't affect the size.

### Box-Sizing:
- **content-box** (default): The padding and border are added outside the content area, increasing the total size of the element.
- **border-box**: The padding and border are included within the width and height, meaning the total size remains the same as the specified width and height.

### Summary:
- **Content** defines the core size of the element.
- **Padding** and **border** increase the element's total size (in **content-box**).
- **Margin** does not affect the element's size but affects the spacing between elements.
