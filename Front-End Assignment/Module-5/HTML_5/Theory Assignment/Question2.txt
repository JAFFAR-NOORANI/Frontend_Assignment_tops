Question 2: What are additional tags used in HTML5 ?

Ans : 

HTML5 introduced several new tags to enhance the structure, semantics, and functionality of webpages. Here are the key additions in short:

1. Structural & Semantic Tags:
   - `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`: Used to define specific parts of the page.

   - `<mark>`, `<progress>`, `<output>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`: Used for content highlighting, progress indicators, and expandable sections.

2. Form Elements:
   - New input types like `email`, `date`, `number`, `range`.

   - `<datalist>`, `<input>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`: Enhance form functionality and user interaction.

3. Media Elements:
   - `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<source>`, `<track>`: For embedding media content like audio and video.

4. Graphics:
   - `<canvas>`, `<svg>`: For rendering 2D graphics and scalable vector graphics.

5. Other:
   - `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`: For media with captions.
   
   - `<time>`, `<wbr>`, `<bdi>`, `<bdo>`: For time, word break hints, and text direction control.

These new tags make HTML more semantic, accessible, and versatile for modern web design.
